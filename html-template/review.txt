The Sequoia Fund has a lengthy track record of picking winners and holding onto them for the long haul.

As of September 05, 2013, the fund has assets totaling almost $7.12 billion invested in 43 different holdings. Its portfolio consists primarily of shares of large- and mid-cap companies.

Earning a spot in Sequoia's portfolio is no small task. According to Morningstar, management usually owns between 10 and 25 stocks at a time (it finished 2010 with 31 names in its portfolio). That makes it one of the more concentrated funds available. The fund scours the market for undervalued companies with strong balance sheets and superior earnings records, and when it finds one it likes, it's loath to get rid of it. One natural consequence of this fund's compact portfolio is that the names at the top account for a large percentage of total assets. For instance, as of the end of 2010, upwards of 10 percent of the fund's portfolio was invested in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, down from a 20 percent allocation at the end of 2009. Lately, management has been holding onto a lot of cash. As of the end of 2010, more than a fifth of its assets were tucked away in cash.
